These files were used as practice to look at another approach to the project.

database.js is where the server is linked with MySQL. This is different than the approach in the main.js file, where we create an http server instead.
this file also includes functions with MySQL queries, which are then exported to app.js for use.

app.js is where the express application is created and is managed by simple get and pull request(s) using those exported functions from database.js.
